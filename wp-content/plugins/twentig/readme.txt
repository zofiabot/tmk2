### The easy way to build a beautiful website.

The Twentig plugin helps you customize the default WordPress theme (Twenty Twenty-Two, Twenty Twenty-One & Twenty Twenty) and all block themes the way you want with Google Fonts, styles, custom layouts, and many more options.

With enhanced Gutenberg blocks, pre-designed block templates, and starter websites, you’ve got everything you need to build stunning pages that look great on any device — no coding or design skills needed.

> “Twentig is a plugin that essentially gives superpowers to the default theme.” — Justin Tadlock, WP Tavern

### Customize the most popular WordPress themes. Your way.

Twentig offers powerful features to customize the default theme (Twenty Twenty-Two, Twenty-One & Twenty Twenty) and all block themes — making it easier than ever to create your own professional website.

**Advanced theme customization.** From post grid to sidebar to header and footer layouts, our plugin provides endless ways to enhance your WordPress theme. Change the look and feel of your website by customizing the fonts (Google Fonts), site layout, global styles, 404 page, and more.

**Custom page templates.** Control the look of your entire page with our page templates. Easily remove the page title, header, footer, or set a transparent header. Now you can use Gutenberg blocks to create a custom hero, landing page, coming soon page, and more.

**Tailored design.** Twentig brings design improvements to the default WordPress theme. Our additional block settings and pre-designed block templates are specially built for it — so it’s simple to make beautiful pages with Gutenberg blocks.

### Do more with Gutenberg blocks.

Twentig enhances the existing Gutenberg blocks — taking the WordPress block editor to a new level of design and creativity.

**Block customization made easy.** We’ve added the right amount of features to the Gutenberg core blocks. So you can easily customize your blocks to fit your needs with just a few clicks.

**Powerful Gutenberg block features.** Twentig provides alternative styles, advanced block settings, and CSS classes. From columns style to group shape divider to typography settings, you have the best tools to customize the Gutenberg blocks and build gorgeous pages.

### Build your pages with ready-to-use templates.

Twentig brings hundreds of pre-designed block patterns and page templates — making it easier and faster than ever to create stunning pages.

**Flexible block templates.** Choose from a variety of versatile block patterns and page templates that you can mix and match to fit your project. Our block template library is designed to enable a wide range of uses and endless design possibilities.

**Professional design.** Our templates are responsive and give your pages a professional look right from the start — no coding or design skills needed.

### Start with a pre-built website.

*This feature is currently only available for the Twenty Twenty-One and Twenty Twenty themes.*

Instead of starting from scratch, you can quickly import one of Twentig’s starter websites crafted by award-winning designers.

**The simple way to import starter websites.** Choose from a variety of starter websites and seamlessly load them in a few seconds in the Customizer. Preview and customize your theme any way you like before publishing it to your live site.
