Create new templates for Full Site Editing themes and create a sticky header without a child theme!

== Description ==
= Template Editor =

With WordPress v5.9 the first default theme with Full Site Editing was launched ... Twenty Twenty-Two.

There is not yet the functionality to add templates that are not part of the theme without a child theme.

Having a FSE theme also removes links to the Customizer.

This plugin changes that!

This plugin will also enable the Template Editor in Gutenberg for full site editing for any theme!

= Reinstate Customizer Links =

Activating the plugin will inject the "Customize" links back into the "Dashboard - Appearance" and Admin Bar locations.

= Edit Existing Templates =

Once you've installed this plugin, head over to "Dashboard - Appearance - Manage Templates" where you can change the title, description and name of customized templates from the active theme or any other theme.

= Duplicate Templates =

Save templates as a copy to the active theme.

This allows you to use the [WordPress Template Hierarchy](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/) to name your templates so that they can be used for custom post types, custom taxonomies, specific post or pages or anything you like!

= Delete Templates =

Easily delete templates from the active theme or any other theme. This doesn't delete the orginal theme template, just any customizations you have made.

= Download Templates =

Download your template as .json files to back them up or to migrate them to another WordPress site.

= Upload Templates =

Upload template .json files to the active theme. This allows you to restor a template you backed up or migrate a template to another WordPress site.

= Sticky Header =

We've added a "Theme Options" section where we have added the ability to enable a sticky header / menu in full site editor themes like Twenty Twenty-Two.

== Installation ==

Easily use this plugin to enable the Template Editor on your site ...

1) Install "Template Editor" automatically or by uploading the ZIP file.
2) Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3) Start using the Template Editor with your theme.
